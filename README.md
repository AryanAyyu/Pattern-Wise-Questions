# Pattern-Wise-Questions

Pattern 1: Sliding Window
In many problems dealing with an array (or a LinkedList), we are asked to find or calculate something among all the contiguous subarrays (or sublists) of a given size. There we use Sliding Window Approach.
Time Complexity : O(N)

Pattern 2: Two Pointers
In problems where we deal with sorted arrays (or LinkedLists) and need to find a set of elements that fulfill certain constraints, the two pointers approach becomes quite useful. The set of elements could be a pair, a triplet or even a subarray.
Time Complexity : O(N^2)

Pattern 3: fast & Slow Pointers
The Fast & Slow pointer approach, also known as the Hare & Tortoise algorithm, is a pointer algorithm that uses two pointers which move through the array (or sequence/LinkedList) at different speeds. This approach is quite useful when dealing with cyclic LinkedLists or arrays.
